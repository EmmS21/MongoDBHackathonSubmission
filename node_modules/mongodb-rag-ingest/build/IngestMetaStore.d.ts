/**
  The ingest meta has information about ingest runs so that the script can
  resume from a known successful run date.

  If the 'since' date given to the embed command is too late, pages that were
  updated during a failed run will not be picked up.

  If too early, more pages and embeddings will be checked than necessary. The
  embed command will not unnecessarily create new embeddings for page updates
  that it has already created embeddings for, but it would still be wasteful to
  have to check potentially all pages and embeddings when the date is early
  enough.
